# Info #
This is a simple (multi-language) Windows GUI that will allow you to download and put directly into your USB/SD device several useful things for the Wii.
Homebrew, the WAD of cIOS, IOS and more.
In detail, you can:
  * Download files from static links (form code.google or other)
  * Download files from dynamic links (for now only mediafire and bootmii.org)
  * Download and patch any IOS
  * Create any version of cIOS (using modmii: http://modmii.zzl.org/home.html )
  * Create a script to download everything you need to mod/update your Wii

Everything will be downloaded from on their official website (which is very important especially with regard to the IOS from NUS), giving the credit to the creator of the programs/homebrew.

I made this application to have the ability to download anything without need to search the web (which in many cases do not turn out to be safe).
